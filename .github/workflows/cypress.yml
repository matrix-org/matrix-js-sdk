    # We want to make the cypress tests a required check for the merge queue.
    #
    # Unfortunately, github doesn't distinguish between "checks needed for branch
    # protection" (ie, the things that must pass before the PR will even be added
    # to the merge queue) and "checks needed in the merge queue". We just have to add
    # the check to the branch protection list.
    #
    # Ergo, if we know we're not going to run the cypress tests, we need to add a
    # passing status check manually.
