This is a functional terminal app which allows you to see the room list for a user, join rooms, send messages and view room membership lists.

To try it out, you will need to edit `app.js` to configure it for your `homeserver`, `access_token` and `user_id`. Then run:

```
 $ npm install
 $ node app
```

Example output:

```
Room List:
[0] Room Invite (0 members)
[1] Room Invite (0 members)
[2] My New Room (2 members)
[3] @megan:localhost (1 members)
[4] True Stuff (7 members)
Global commands:
  '/help' : Show this help.
Room list index commands:
  '/enter <index>' Enter a room, e.g. '/enter 5'
Room commands:
  '/exit' Return to the room list index.
  '/members' Show the room member list.

$ /enter 2
