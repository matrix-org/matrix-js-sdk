     * When we run {@link processRootEvent} (which I think happens during the
     * setting-up of the thread), we set this to the event pointed to by the
     * server in `latest_event` [1] that came through with the thread root.
     *
     * [1]: https://spec.matrix.org/v1.8/client-server-api/#server-side-aggregation-of-mthread-relationships
     *
     * Later, when we have populated the timeline, this is set to undefined, so
     * that methods like {@link replyToEvent} fall through to use lastReply,
     * which looks in the timeline for the latest event that is a "thread reply"
     * i.e. directly refers to the thread root with an m.thread relation.
     *
     * So it looks like this is only really relevant when initialEventsFetched
     * is false, because as soon as the initial events have been fetched, we
     * should have a timeline (I think).
     *
     * If all replies in this thread are redacted, this is set to the root
     * event. I'm not clear what the meaning of this is, since usually after the
     * initial events have been fetched, lastEvent should be undefined.
     * In fact, the whole usage inside onRedaction looks suspect - it may be
     * that we were thinking lastEvent always refers to the actual last event,
     * but it only does so before initialEventsFetched becomes true.
     *
     * The usage of lastEvent inside {@link onEcho} looks suspicious, since I'd
     * think we probably mean {@link replyToEvent} there - we are trying not to
     * echo a duplicate event, and we probably want that behaviour even after
     * initialEventsFetched has become true.
