 * Used in element-web as a temporary hack to handle all the localStorage errors on the highest level possible
 * As of 15.11.2021 (DD/MM/YYYY) we're not properly handling local storage exceptions anywhere.
 * This store, as an event emitter, is used to re-emit local storage exceptions so that we can handle them
 * and show some kind of a "It's dead Jim" modal to the users, telling them that hey,
 * maybe you should check out your disk, as it's probably dying and your session may die with it.
 * See: https://github.com/vector-im/element-web/issues/18423
